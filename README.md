# Compass React Native (Non Expo)
A simple compass app built with react-native. No expo. Expo version can be found here [here](https://github.com/rahulhaque/compass-react-native).


## Description
A very simple demonstration of how to use device's built in `Magnetometer` sensor to identify direction and calculate degree of angle. This app uses the package [react-native-sensors](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors).


## Todo
- Build and test the app on iOS device.
(I am yet to have a Mac, so that I can install Xcode and build iOS version of the app. That's why, the `/ios` directory does not contain any dependencies or config required for the `react-native-sensors`)


## Run the App
- Clone or download the repository. 
- `cd` into directory. 
- Run `npm install` then `react-native run-android`.
